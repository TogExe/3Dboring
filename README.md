# 3Dboring a boring 3D game engine
*I mostly created this for my future projects and for designing a simple 3d game engine for my stupid brain*

I hope you all enjoy

feel free to update it would be cool :3
## Currently just testing and trying to improve the system before making a simple framework
**Known issues we (I) work on** : 
- [ ] Optimisation
- [ ] Method used to rotate up and down
- [ ] rendering order for the triangle within an object
- [ ] more to come
- [x] Issues where objects behind the visible plane where displayed on screen resulting to an inverted movement on some 3D objects
